COMPARISON: None  FINDINGS:  On the right side, there is opacification of the middle ear cavity and the most medial portion of the external auditory canal. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The medial bony floor of the EAC which normally shows focal thinning appears slightly thinner than on the left side.</span> The remainder of the external auditory canal is patent, but the caliber of of the external auditory canal is somewhat narrowed, probably developmental in nature. The tympanic membrane is obscured by the overlying fluid.</div>

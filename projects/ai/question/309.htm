<div style="border-style:solid">An associated arachnoid cyst in the left cerebellopontine angle cannot be excluded. If clinically warranted, a whole brain MRI might be performed for better delineation of the area. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">IMPRESSION:  Small internal auditory canals, bilaterally, with poor visualization of the cochlear nerves, as detailed above.</span> Slight prominence of the vestibular aqueducts, of uncertain significance. Suggestion of small prior insult/arachnoid cyst in the left cerebellar hemisphere, please see comment above.</div>

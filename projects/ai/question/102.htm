No definite erosion is identified in the region of the tegmen tympani but it appears slightly thinner and more bowed out. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The scutum is at least partially absent.</span> The ossicular erosion has progressed since the prior exam (correlate with surgical procedure).

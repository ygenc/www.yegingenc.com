<div style="border-style:solid">The vestibulo-cochlear nerves are seen and appear normal. The lateral semicircular canal is not well seen on the TSE T2 images but appears unremarkable on CISS and HASTE images, so this is likely artifactual. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The inner ear structures, including the semicircular canals, vestibule, and cochlea are otherwise unremarkable.</span> The vestibular aqueduct is not enlarged. On the left side, the external auditory canal is patent.</div>

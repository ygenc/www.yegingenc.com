<div style="border-style:solid">The bilateral IACS are stenotic and small. No CNVIII is seen to course into the IACs on either side. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">On each side, there is a separate, superiorly located canal in the petrous temporal bone, extending from the cerebellopontine angle medially to join the stenotic IAC in its most lateral portion near the cochlea, and which appear to carry the facial nerves on each side.</span> End of addendum</div>

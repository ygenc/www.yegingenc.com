<div style="border-style:solid">LEFT EAR  On the left side, the external auditory canal is completely atretic (osseous and cartilaginous portion). As a result the tympanic membrane is absent. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The middle ear cavity is clear, however the study is notable for abnormal malleus, as the head is smaller, and the long process appears to be absent.</span> The malleus and the incus appear fused. The stapes and the incus appear grossly normal.</div>

<div style="border-style:solid">The middle ear cavity is clear. The vestibulo-cochlear nerves are seen and appear normal. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The lateral semicircular canal is not well seen on the TSE T2 images but appears unremarkable on CISS and HASTE images, so this is likely artifactual.</span> The inner ear structures, including the semicircular canals, vestibule, and cochlea are otherwise unremarkable. The vestibular aqueduct is not enlarged.</div>

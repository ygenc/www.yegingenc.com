<div style="border-style:solid">Optic nerve hypoplasia. Hearing loss  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal 3D T1 gradient echo with axial reformations, axial 3D TSE T2, coronal TSE T2, axial and coronal FLAIR, and axial diffusion weighted imaging were performed on a 3.0 Tesla system. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">In addition, axial 3D CISS through the internal auditory canals and through the orbits were obtained with coronal and sagittal reformations.</span> COMPARISON: [**Date**] MRI  FINDINGS: Redemonstrated are diffuse areas of gray matter irregularities involving both hemispheres, right greater than left, representing polymicrogyria, in association with diffuse dysmorphic gyral pattern. The lateral ventricles are dysmorphic in configuration, right greater than left.</div>

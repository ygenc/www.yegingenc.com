<div style="border-style:solid">The oval window fossae appear dysmorphic, being malrotated, and abnormally thickened and narrowed (worse on the left than the right). The right carotid artery has an atypical course, but appears to remain covered by a thin plate of bone where it approaches the middle ear cavity. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The semicircular canals are unremarkable.</span> The cochleas and vestibules are globular. The vestibular aqueducts are not enlarged.</div>

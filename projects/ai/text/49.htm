<div style="border-style:solid">There is a small amount of irregular soft tissue density in the middle ear cavity located just lateral to the incus. The anterior/superior aspect of the head of the malleus lies in close proximity to the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity, however there does appear to be a cleft separating the head of the malleus and the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">The malleus and incus are otherwise intact.</span> The stapes is very faintly visualized, noting that it may be partially obscured by cranial nerve VII. There appears to be dehiscence of a portion of the horizontal canal for the cranial nerve VII.</div>

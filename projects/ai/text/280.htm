<div style="border-style:solid">CT TEMPORAL BONES, WITHOUT CONTRAST  CLINICAL INDICATION: sensorineural hearing loss  TECHNIQUE:  High-resolution 0.75 mm sections through the temporal bones were obtained in the axial plane and were reformatted in the coronal plane. Images were viewed on soft tissue and bone windows. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">COMPARISON: None  FINDINGS:  There is apparent focal enlargement of the mastoid portion of the descending facial nerve canals bilaterally, with the left slightly larger than the right.</span> There is no associated bony erosive changes. When reviewed with axial reconstructions parallel to the hard palate, this apparent abnormality reduces but still remains more visible on the right, but is of dubious significance, given the fair degree of symmetry.</div>

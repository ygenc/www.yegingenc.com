<div style="border-style:solid">The tympanic cavity is larger than on the contralateral side. There is a small osseous discontinuity in the atretic plate. <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Because of the EAC atresia the tympanic membrane is absent and consequently the handle of the malleus is foreshortened and thickened.</span> The anterosuperior portion of the head of the malleus may be attached to the roof of the tympanic cavity or may be abutting it. The incus and the stapes appear normal.</div>

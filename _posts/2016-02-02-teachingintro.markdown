I teach Data Mining and Database Management cousrses at Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems at Pace University. Prior, I was teaching Business Analystics courses in Manhattan College. I have thought Business Statistics classes both at introductory and advanced levels, and the Analytical Decision Modeling course as part of the Business Analytics Program at Manhattan College.

This book:
        <br>
 <ul>
  <li>Is not meant to be an introduction to Python or to programming in general; I assume the reader has familiarity with the Python language, including defining functions, assigning variables, calling methods of objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks.</li>
  <li>Is for individuals who want to learn the language with the aim of using it as a tool for data-intensive and computational science</li>
  <li>Focuses on a particular package or tool that contributes a fundamental piece of the Python Data Sciece story in each chapter</li>
  </ul>

expert,Peer to peer chat communication with end to end encryption would be a good place to start...though there are exploits that target TLS to try and get around SSL / TSL via man in the middle attacks you can't have secure communication without strong encryption. To build upon this idea can have chat clients where people have unique identifiers that only allow them to communicate with those they have chosen to communicate with up front very similar to the way the Signal app uses your mobile address book to prove you know and hence can connect with some one.,4.7,6.7,6.0,6.0,6.7,5.7,6.2,3.0,2.7,5.3,5.7,5.7,2.8,5.6,5,4,7,6,5,5,38,female,0.675069376,0.478293983,masterabove,Director of Engineering & PhD Student
